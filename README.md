# Data mining Portuguese school performance
This dataset consists of student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The 33 data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por) (University of Minho, & Cortez, P, 2014).

## Goal
The goal for this project is to apply multiple supervised learning classification algorithms to the chosen dataset for researching the performance of students in relation to predicting students' grades. For this different methods will be applied such as the decision trees, neural networks, AUC and ROC curve. 

## Specifications
The software which will be used is Python. The reason behind this is that Python has a handful of useful libraries that can be utilized for this project.
The classification algorithms which will be implemented to solve the problem are the following:
A decision tree to see if an accurate prediction can be made for the grades of students.
A neural network will be applied to the dataset to see how a more complex algorithm works with this kind of dataset.
The decision tree can be compared to the neural networks. The accuracy of the trees will be tested with the help of AUC score and ROC curve.
